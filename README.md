<h1 align="center">Ariadne's Thread</h1>

You are <strong>Theseus</strong>, trapped within the endless corridors
        of the Labyrinth. Deep within, the Minotaur lurks. But you are not
        alone. Ariadne’s voice will guide you. To escape, follow the golden
        thread and solve the Labyrinth’s mysteries. But be warned: the Minotaur
        is always watching.
